"""Code shared with the backend stays identical (.github#5).

``app/pgq.py`` (the Kombu transport) and ``app/task_contract.py`` (event
types, payloads, sealed results) exist in ``backend`` and ``worker`` until
a shared package is decided. The same test in both repositories pins their
content: change a file in one repository, copy it to the other and update
the hash in both tests.
